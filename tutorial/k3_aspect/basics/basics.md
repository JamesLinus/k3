# Kermeta3 aspects


Kermeta3 aspects are based on a set of xTend annotations and the use of some xTend syntax.

In a nutshell:
1. An annotation _**Aspect**_ on the class corresponding to the aspect.
2. A dedicated variable _**_self**_ to refer to the host base class
3. Use xTend special import ***import static extension*** to seamlessly use the aspect from  k3/xTend programs
