K3
==

K3 is an action language build on top of the Xtend programming language in order to use it for executable metamodeling.

Its key feature allows to "re-open" classes of an Ecore metamodel and to weave new features or operations in these classes.

Please have a look to the **[http://diverse-project.github.io/k3/](http://diverse-project.github.io/k3/)** for more details and tutorials.
