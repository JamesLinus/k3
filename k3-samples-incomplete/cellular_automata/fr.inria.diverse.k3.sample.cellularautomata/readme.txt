The project CellularAutomata is a representation of the game of life.

The project is decomposed on 4 operationals packages (source code) and 2 models packages (designed for tests)

The operational package "fr.inria.diverse.k3.sample.cellularautomata.evaluator" is unused because of a bug on K3 that is not able to manipulate datas between packages

To test simulator :
- go to package "fr.inria.diverse.k3.sample.cellularautomata.simulator"
- right click on file "TestExecutionSimulator.xtend" and select java application

To test generator :
- go to package "fr.inria.diverse.k3.sample.cellularautomata.vm.generator"
- right click on file "TestExecutionGenerator.xtend" and select java application
